# NYIT_Vancouver_CSCI651_AlgorithmConcepts
**Description for NYIT Vancouver CSCI651 Algorithm Concepts:**

This course, taught by Dr. Zhida Li, is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of algorithm design and analysis. The course begins with a review of Abstract Data Structures, which are fundamental building blocks of many algorithms.

The course covers a variety of design methods, including divide-and-conquer, the greedy method, dynamic programming, and basic traversal and search techniques. Students will learn how to use these design methods to solve a wide range of problems, including algebraic and geometric problems.

In addition to design methods, the course also emphasizes the importance of understanding space and time complexity in algorithm design. Students will learn how to analyze the performance of algorithms, and will explore techniques for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms in terms of both time and space complexity.

The course also covers NP-Hard and NP-Complete classes, which are important concepts in computational complexity theory. By understanding these classes, students will gain a deeper understanding of the computational complexity of problems and be better equipped to design and analyze algorithms for solving them.

Throughout the course, students will be challenged to apply what they've learned to solve real-world problems. By the end of the course, students will have a solid foundation in algorithm design and analysis that can be applied to a wide range of problems. They will be able to design and analyze new algorithms for themselves, and will be prepared to continue their works or studies in related areas of computer science.
